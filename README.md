Interalyze is an interview analytics platform that offers recruiters data-driven insights into the performance of candidates by analyzing verbal and non-verbal cues from the interviews. The tool converts online video interviews to text first, after which the language can be examined for signs of stress, answer relevance, personality, and confidence levels. While this is in process, computer vision will monitor attention by eye gaze and head movement to measure the engagement levels of the candidate during the conversation. Interalyze uses natural language processing, joined with computer vision, to deliver analyses for each interview that contain aspects such as stress levels based on speech patterns, attention levels from visual cues, and relevance of responses to questions. This analytics comes in insights for recruiters on the fit of a candidate for the position.
